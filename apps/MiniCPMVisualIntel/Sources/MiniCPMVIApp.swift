// MiniCPMVIApp.swift — app entry + navigation router.
//
// The router bridges the system-facing intents back into the UI: an `OpenIntent` (tap a Visual
// Intelligence result) or the "Continue in app" schema intent runs `perform()`, which drives this
// `@Observable` router, which the view presents. The engine and the router are registered as App
// Intents dependencies in `init()` so `@Dependency` resolves them — crucially also during the
// background launch the system uses to run the Visual Intelligence query.

    static let shared = AppRouter()

    /// A capture handed off from Visual Intelligence, to (re)answer in the foreground where the
    /// app has its full memory budget. Carried as JPEG `Data` (Sendable) — the view decodes it.
    var pendingImageData: Data?
    /// An answer already produced inside the VI background launch (flag A), to show directly.
    var pendingAnswer: String?

    /// A tapped VI result. An already-produced answer is shown; a tapped teaser re-answers in the
    /// foreground from the thumbnail it carried.
