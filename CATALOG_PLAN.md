# Catalog plan — making the published catalog reproducible and checkable

> **Subordinate to [`../ZOO_BLUEPRINT.md`](../ZOO_BLUEPRINT.md).** The blueprint decides *what
> the zoo ships and why*; this plan only makes what is already shipped reproducible and
> verifiable. Where the two disagree, the blueprint wins.
>
> Status: **C0, C1, C2 and C4.2/C4.3 are done, and every tier-1 defect is fixed or
> declared** (2026-07-25). C3 (oracles) and C4.1 (device tier) are not started.
> No step here publishes anything — see [Guardrails](#guardrails).

## Why this is not a new pillar

The blueprint's pillars need this work but do not describe it:

| Blueprint pillar | What it assumes | What this plan supplies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **P1 Model coverage** — keep shipping models Apple doesn't | that a shipped port stays shipped across SDK betas | a check that runs over the whole catalog in minutes after each beta |
| **P5 Knowledge** — the porting playbook | that "how it was made" is written down | the machine-readable half of it: `models/<model>/recipe.toml` |
| **P6 Community ops** — monthly drops, contributions | that a contributor can reproduce a bundle without asking | `zoo_convert.py run <name>` plus the prerequisites it needs |

**Numbering:** the blueprint owns `P1`–`P6` for pillars. This plan's phases are `C0`–`C4` so
that "P2" means one thing in both documents. (The earlier draft of this file reused P0–P4 and
collided with the blueprint's pillar numbers.)

## What the catalog actually looks like

Measured 2026-07-25 by `scripts/gen_inventory.py`; the full table is
[`models/_INVENTORY.md`](models/_INVENTORY.md).

| Layer | Count |
| --- | --- |
| Published Hugging Face repos | **123** (122 owned + 1 contributor-owned) |
| Of those, Core AI repos | **70** (the rest: pre-Core-AI Core ML ports, LiteRT collaboration repos) |
| Bundles inside them | **238** |
| Core AI repos with a card in `models/<model>/` | **52** |
| Repos with a recipe | **52** (was 6) |
| Bundles with an automated tier-1 check | **222** (was ~0) |
| Core AI repos with no downloads in 30 days | **55** |

Ten of the uncarded repos are the `-CoreAI-official` bench exports of Apple's own recipes —
blueprint P2, not undocumented ports. Eight are zoo ports published without a card; those are
listed for the owner.

## The three things that blocked reproduction

1. **Scripts hardcoded one machine's home directory.** 47 files, 69 occurrences — not the 15
   the earlier draft counted. Fixed in C0.1.
2. **Prerequisites were prose.** `notes = ["Runtime needs apps/…patch + COREAI_CHUNK_THRESHOLD=1"]`
   is invisible to a runner. Fixed in C2 by splitting them into fields, and by distinguishing
   *export-time* prerequisites from *run-time* ones — a bundle rebuilt without the runtime
   patch looks correct and then misbehaves in the app.
3. **The shipped configuration was often unrecorded.** Fixed where it could be derived; where it
   could not, the entry says so instead of guessing.

## Phases

### C0 — make the existing tree honest ✅ done

- **C0.1 Remove hardcoded paths.** 47 files now resolve through `conversion/_paths.py`
  (`ZOO_WORK_ROOT` / `ZOO_EXPORTS` / `ZOO_CODE_ROOT` / `HF_HUB_CACHE`, with defaults that
  reproduce the layout the published bundles were built in).
  *Accepted*: `grep -rln "/Users/<name>" conversion/` returns nothing.
- **C0.2 Resolve working-tree drift.** Far more than the 6 modified files and 2 untracked
  directories the draft listed: 75 uncommitted source files, including the exporters for
  several shipped bundles. Committed as source; oracle dumps, HF staging directories and the
  reassembled upstream VoxCPM reference are covered by per-port `.gitignore` files. Nothing was
  deleted.
  *Accepted*: `git status --porcelain conversion` is empty.
- **C0.3 Inventory.** `models/_INVENTORY.md`, generated — do not hand-edit.
  *Accepted*: every published repo has a row with downloads, bundle count, card, recipe, kit
  enrollment and tier-1 result.

### C1 — tier-1 verification ✅ done

`conversion/zoo_verify.py` checks four things per bundle with no oracle, no device and no
weights: eos/bos, chat template, context length, declared precision.

**Change from the draft:** expectations are **read from the source repository at run time**
rather than transcribed into 50 hand-written `verify.toml` files. A transcription can be wrong
and goes stale; the source repo cannot. `models/<model>/verify.toml` is now only for recording a
*deliberate* deviation — and once recorded, the recorded value becomes the bar.

First full run over 222 bundles: **162 PASS, 8 DIFF, 10 FAIL, 42 SKIPPED**. After the
fixes those became **180 PASS, 0 DIFF, 0 FAIL, 42 SKIPPED** — see Open questions.

*Accepted*: the defect list exists and Gemma-4-12B and 31B are on it with eos mismatches.

**But the known-answer test's premise was wrong, and the result is more useful than the test.**
The draft expected 12B/31B to be shipping `eos_token: "<eos>"`. They are not: they ship
`<turn|>`, Gemma 4's turn terminator — they are the two that were *fixed*. E2B and E4B still
ship `<eos>`, which a host loop stops on only at end-of-sequence, never at end-of-turn. Both
sets are flagged (12B/31B as an undeclared deviation from source, E2B/E4B as an `eos vs eot`
finding), so the acceptance test passes either way — but the defect is in the models the draft
called clean. Verification earns its keep by contradicting the plan that asked for it.

The 10 FAILs are all Gemma 4 E2B/E4B bundles shipping **no chat template at all** while their
source ships one; E2B is the most-downloaded text model in the catalog.

### C2 — recipes for the carded catalog ✅ done

6 → **56 recipes**, 38 `verified` and 18 `unverified`, one `recipe.toml` per model
directory beside its card.

Recipes are **derived, not remembered**: the exporters build their bundle name from their
arguments, so a published name inverts back to a command, and where a card also documents a
command the two are checked against each other. `verified` means both agree (or the naming rule
determines the arguments outright). `unverified` means a flag changes the artifact but not the
name — `--head-sym` on the MoE gather exports, the mode behind a bare `decoder/` directory —
and the entry records the known part plus the exact question.

*Accepted*: `zoo_convert.py run <name> --dry-run` prints a complete command plus prerequisites
for all 38 verified recipes; the unverified ones refuse to run without `--force`.

### C3 — oracles and tiers 2–3 (not started)

Order strictly by 30-day downloads from `_INVENTORY.md`. The 55 zero-download Core AI repos are
last, and some of them are candidates for unpublishing rather than verifying.

- **C3.1** Generalise the per-model scripts in `_smoke/` into one oracle generator and one
  comparator.
- **C3.2** Generate oracles and publish them beside each bundle under `oracle/`.
  **Each upload is user-gated** (blueprint: pushes and external posts are user-gated).
- **C3.3** Fill `[numeric]` and `[generation]` expectations. Tolerances come from measurement,
  per architecture — never a global default.

Mac-GPU work in this phase takes the `_GPU_LOCK` at the work root
(`conversion/_paths.py: gpu_lock()`), per the blueprint's parallel-session rule.

*Accept*: the top 20 models by downloads pass tiers 1–3 or have a recorded reason they cannot.

### C4 — device tier and layout (C4.2/C4.3 done; C4.1 not started)

- **C4.1** Wire the nightly device gate to a `[device]` expectation. `require_backend` must fail
  on silent CPU fallback, not warn.
- **C4.2 Layout ✅ done.** Cards moved to `models/<model>/README.md` beside their
  `recipe.toml`, mirroring `apple/coreai-models` (which is `models/<family>/README.md` +
  optional `export.py` / `*.yaml`). Two deliberate differences: the exporters stay in
  `conversion/` because several families share one (the Qwen3.5 script also drives Ornith and
  Qwen3.6-27B), and `recipe.toml` / `verify.toml` are our additions — Apple has no equivalent.
  The gen-cards conflict was resolved rather than avoided: `cards.json` now points at the new
  paths, so the "Use it" block still round-trips byte-identically to the Hugging Face README.
  Every old `zoo/<model>.md` path stays as a redirect stub, because ~50 published Hugging Face
  READMEs link to it. **`scripts/gen-cards` has not been re-run** — it builds Swift and needs
  the kit checkout; the owner should run it once to confirm the round-trip.
- **C4.3 ✅ done.** `skills/` mirrors Apple's agent-plugin layout (`.claude-plugin`,
  `.codex-plugin`, `gemini-extension.json`, `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) with two skills:
  `reproduce-a-zoo-model` and `port-a-model-to-the-zoo`. `models/index.json` is the
  machine-readable catalog they read first.

*Accept*: an agent given only this repo's README can reproduce and verify one model end to end.

## Open questions for the owner

Six of the seven questions this work turned up are now closed. What is left needs knowledge
only the owner has.

**Still open — one answer each:**

1. **18 unverified recipes.** A flag changed the artifact but not its name, so the published
   bundle cannot say which was used. Mostly "was `--head-sym` passed?" on the MoE gather
   exports. Listed with their exact questions in `models/_INVENTORY.md` §3.
2. **The stub cards.** Eight ports (FLUX.2 klein, both VoxCPMs, Stable Audio, RWKV7-Goose,
   Qwen2.5-Omni audio, qwen3.5-4B, AdcSR) now have a card that records what is published and
   points at the Hugging Face page as the authority. They still need a real card — or a
   decision to unpublish, since all eight had no downloads last month.
3. **`scripts/gen-cards` has not been re-run** since the layout moved. It builds Swift and
   needs the kit checkout; one run confirms the card ↔ Hugging Face README round-trip.
4. **Refreshing the Gemma-4-12B/31B chat template.** They carry the revision they were gated
   against; Google revised theirs on 2026-07-09 (tool-calling loops, turn closures, thinking
   order). Declared in `models/gemma4-12b/verify.toml` rather than silently updated, because
   changing it changes prompt formatting for an artifact whose numbers were measured with the
   old one.

**Closed (2026-07-25):**

- **10 FAIL bundles** — Gemma 4 E2B/E4B shipped no chat template. Root cause was the exporter:
  `export_gemma4_decode_pipelined.py` (and the VL / mixed-bit / pf variants) copied
  `tokenizer.json`, `tokenizer_config.json` and `special_tokens_map.json` but not
  `chat_template.jinja`, while the 12B exporter did — which is exactly why 12B/31B had one.
  Exporters fixed, and the template added to the 10 published bundles.
- **`eos` on E2B/E4B** — they stopped at `<eos>` (end of sequence) rather than `<turn|>` (end of
  turn); `apps/CoreAIChat` hardcodes `EOT = 106` to work around it, and the source's own
  `eot_token` says `<turn|>`. Corrected on the 12 published bundles and declared in
  `verify.toml` so it reads as intentional, not as drift.
- **MiniCPM5-1B `eos`** — same class, resolved from evidence rather than changed: the source's
  chat template emits only `<|im_start|>`/`<|im_end|>` and its `generation_config` lists both
  `</s>` and `<|im_end|>` as stop ids, so the bundle's `<|im_end|>` is correct. Declared.
- **Nemotron-3-Nano chat template** — was not drift at all. The bundle ships the template both
  as a file and inside `tokenizer_config.json`, and the two differ by 7 bytes; the verifier was
  comparing the field while transformers reads the file. Precedence fixed in the checker.
- **The MinerU metadata leak** — `hf_model_id` and `tokenizer` held an absolute path from this
  machine, published. Now names the upstream model.
- **Two cards pointing at the wrong exporter** — the qwen3.6-35B and GLM-4.7-Flash "How to
  reproduce" blocks named the pre-gather-kernel script, which produces a bundle that was never
  published. Both now show the shipped command first and label the other.

After the fixes: **222 bundles, 180 PASS, 0 FAIL, 0 undeclared DIFF, 42 skipped.**

Every published change was backed up first to
`$ZOO_WORK_ROOT/_hf_backup/2026-07-25-chat-template-eos/` (the 27 affected files plus the
pre-change repo revisions), and Hugging Face keeps the full history, so each commit is
revertible. The script that made them is `conversion/_publish_tier1_fixes.py`.

## Instructions for the agent

- Work one phase at a time and run its acceptance test before moving on. If it fails, fix it;
  do not redefine the test. If the test's *premise* turns out to be wrong (as C1's did), report
  that rather than adjusting the result to match.
- **Never guess a shipped configuration.** `status = "unverified"` plus a precise question is
  the correct output when the repo does not record it.
- Read before writing. `PORTING.md` is the path, `knowledge/*.md` the depth,
  `conversion/overlay/README.md` the model-code patch mechanism, and the model's own card is
  usually the record of what shipped.
- One-off scripts (`_*_hf_upload.py`) are often the only copy of a publishing step. Confirm
  with the owner before deleting one.
- Code comments and documentation in English.

## Guardrails

- **No publishing.** No Hugging Face pushes, no posts, no PRs against `apple/*`. Uploading
  oracles in C3.2 requires explicit approval each time.
- **No deletion of artifacts.** Never `rm` bundles, oracles or export outputs; several are the
  only copy in existence. Ignore them in git instead.
- **Keep the repo small.** No models, checkpoints, build output, `.venv` or caches.
- **Do not change export hyperparameters while migrating.** A recipe must reproduce the
  published bundle, not improve it. Improvements are a separate, owner-approved change.
- Verification tiers that cannot run report `skipped`. Never `pass` for a tier that did not
  execute.
