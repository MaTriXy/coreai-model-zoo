# Head-to-head: Core AI vs Meta's ExecuTorch-Metal build of the same model.
#
# INTERLEAVED, not block-ordered. The first attempt ran all three ExecuTorch
# prompts and then all three Core AI prompts, and both sides decayed inside
# their own block (ExecuTorch 23.5 -> 17.4 tok/s across two prompts) — running
# a 30B for minutes heats the GPU, so whoever goes second is measured on a
# hotter machine. Absolute tok/s on this machine swings ~30% with thermal
# state; only an A/B/A/B ratio taken close in time is meaningful.
#
# Per prompt: ExecuTorch, Core AI, ExecuTorch, Core AI. Report both rounds.
